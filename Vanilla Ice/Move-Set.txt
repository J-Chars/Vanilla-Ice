=== STAND ===

The Stand mechanic is an interesting one. When pressing 2 kicks of any kind, you will be in "Stand On" mode, and pressing
two kicks when Stand On will put you in Stand Off. When Stand On, you will generally recieve better attacks, damage, but recieve 
less combo possibility. Stand On will increase your defense by 20% and also you will negate all chip damage, and blocking Stand On 
will not affect your guard meter. The caveat here is that you have a unique Stand meter. When Stand On it will decrease when 
you take a hit or block. Once it's at 0, you will be put in a guard crush type state known as a "Stand Crash" where you are vulnerable 
for a second. However, when Stand Off, your Stand Guage slowly refills, and takes ~3 seconds to refill from 0. If you're smart 
you will most likely not have your Stand Guage that low. Each character with this Stand mechanic has their own Stand Guage strength. 
Some will be strong and be difficult to Stand Crash, others can be crashed in just a few hits. It adds a new dimension to the character.

=== SUPERS ===


- Tandem -
Command: D, DB, B, D, DB, B, K
Meter Cost: 1, takes more depending on button

The tandem is a unique super to active Stand users in JoJo. When you do the command, you're put in a super pause state
and when you input buttons during this super pause, the Stand comes out and plays back those inputs you do. For example,
you do tandem and input LP, MP, and HP in that order, the Stand will come out and do LP, MP and HP. Tandems have levels,
LK being level 1, MK being level 2, and HK being level 3, and they each take 1, 2, and 3 bars respectively. Depending on
your tandem level, the amount of time you get to input stuff will vary, with level 1 being around 0.5 seconds, level 2
being around 0.8 seconds, and level 3 being around 1.1 seconds. Optimally, you will have 3 inputs in level 1, 9 inputs
in level 2, and 15 in level 3. You can input more if you're fast enough, but optimally that's the most you have.
